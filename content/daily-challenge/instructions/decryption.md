# 🗝️ **Secret Message Decryption Instructions**

## **Step 1: Gather Your Key Fragments**

* Each of you has a part of the daily key.
* Work together to combine your parts:

  * **Caesar Cipher:** Add the three numbers together.
  * **Vigenère Cipher:** Put your letters together in order to form a secret word (this is the key word).

## **Step 2: Determine the Cipher Type for Today**

* Ask Mom or check your daily key card to see which cipher was used:

  * **Caesar Cipher:** You will use a number key.
  * **Vigenère Cipher:** You will use a word key.

## **Step 3: Decrypt the Message**

### 📝 **If it’s a Caesar Cipher:**

1. Take the final number key you calculated.
2. For each letter in the message:

   * Count *backward* in the alphabet by that number.
   * Example: If the key is **3**, and the letter is **D**, count back 3 letters to get **A**.
3. Write down each decoded letter to reveal part of the message!

##### 📝 **If it’s a Vigenère Cipher:**

1. Use the word key you assembled.
2. For each letter in the message:

   * Find the matching letter in the key (repeat the key if it’s too short).
   * Find how many letters to count backward by using the key letter (A = 0, B = 1, C = 2, …).
   * Example: If the message letter is **K** and the key letter is **B** (1), count back **1** letter to **J**.
3. Keep going until the whole message is revealed!
