# 🗝️ **Welcome to the Great Family Cipher Challenge!**

Dear Adventurers,

A mysterious world of hidden messages, secret codes, and exciting surprises awaits you! But beware... these secrets won’t reveal themselves easily. It will take teamwork, clever thinking, and daily effort to unlock them. Are you ready to become Codebreakers Extraordinaire?

## 📚 **How This Works**

Each week, a special secret message is hidden somewhere in the house. You will:

1. Complete **Daily Challenges** to earn pieces of a special **Cipher Key**.
2. Work **together** to combine your pieces and figure out the key for that day.
3. Use the key to peel away one layer of the secret message’s encryption.
4. On the final day, fully unlock the message and discover where the surprise is hidden!

### 🧩 **Your Roles**

* Each of you will receive **one piece of the key each day**.
* Only by working together will you reveal the full key and unlock that day’s puzzle piece.
* If a challenge is not completed, that key fragment remains hidden!

### 🔐 **The Ciphers You’ll Encounter**

1. **Caesar Cipher** – Slide letters backward in the alphabet by the key number.
2. **Vigenère Cipher** – Use a secret word to figure out how many steps back to count for each letter.

Don’t worry—your mother holds the secrets and will guide you along the way!
